# Website Builder

## Create a HTML file for your own personalized website

The application will allow users to **customize their web page** including and not limited to:
- Title
- Title banner color selection
- Body of text
- Styling of text

This application will be useful for people wanting to create their own website to share interesting information 
to the world. It could be to blog cool summer trips, or it could be to display their personal endeavors. I am 
pursuing this project because I love the idea of allowing people to share information more easily.
